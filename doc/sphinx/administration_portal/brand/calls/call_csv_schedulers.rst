*******************
Call CSV schedulers
*******************

This section allows programming the automatic periodical creation of CSV reports.

.. note:: This section is identical to :ref:`Invoice schedulers` except to the fields that do not apply to CSVs (Invoice
          number sequence, Template, Call discount, Tax rate).

Apart from the fields above, everything described in :ref:`Invoice schedulers` applies here:

- Frequency/Unit configuration.
- Email send.
- View generated CSVs in **List of Call CSV reports**.
- Next execution date.
- Last execution date and result (success/error).
