            This setting chooses the SIP method to update the other party's name and number during the conversation (e.g. due to transfers).<br><br>
            UPDATE method is the preferred one as it doesn't imply 3 messages like INVITE does. <br><br>However, some phones do not support UPDATE, so INVITE legacy method is also supported.
